help me plan a solution for supporting parental wishlists.

key differences in a parent wishlist:
they should be able to create a list of items in the same way that kids can.
those items should not need approval
they should not see what has been reserved. 
other parents should see those items and be able to reserve them
items from a parent wishlist should show up on family member views
